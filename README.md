## Registry Reporting Reports

### Goal
The goal is to draft a default Registry Report that would be available through the [Registry Reporting Repository] and to submit it as an IETF best practice draft that hopefully result in a [RFC].

### The Current Status
This idea was raised in the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee.

### Validation of IETF draft
You may validate the draft document with https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/
